# Balancing Object Recognition and Spatial Reasoning in 3D Vision via Intent-Aware Vision-Guided Language Refinement

This repository provides the core implementation of the proposed framework $V^3$-LLM, including the intent-aware vision-guided language refinement mechanism (IVR-LLM).

The complete codebase is currently under active development and preparation. Additional modules, training scripts, and documentation will be released progressively.
